<br>
Test your wits against the Evil Goblin's Secret Number Game! This fiendishly fun guessing game challenges you to crack the goblin's secret number within a limited number of tries. Be warned, the goblin is a notorious trickster, so stay sharp and use your best logic skills to prevail!
<br><br>

Key Features:

1. Thrilling Goblin Taunts: The Evil Goblin will taunt and jeer as you attempt to guess his number, adding a touch of humor (and perhaps a little frustration) to the challenge.
2. Dynamic Range Adjustment: With each guess, the game cleverly adjusts the possible range of the secret number, keeping you on your toes and requiring strategic thinking.
3. Satisfying Victory: Guess the correct number within the allotted tries, and relish the sweet satisfaction of defeating the Evil Goblin!

2. Clone your copy of this repo using `git clone your-forked-url`

  ```
  git clone git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/guess-the-number-python.git
  ```
<br>

6. Locate to `guess-the-number-python` folder in your code editor (I use VS Code) & start coding.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Create start page
- [x] Create how to play page
- [x] Create 3 levels
- [x] Use algorithm to reduce the range when guessed wrong, with 3 guesses per level.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/theakhinabraham/guess-the-number-python/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<h2>How to get access to my project: </h2>

1. Fork this repository (and leave a star if you like) by click on the `fork` button on the top right side.
2. Clone your copy of this repo using `git clone your-forked-url`

  ```
  git clone git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/guess-the-number-python.git
  ```
<br>

3. Navigate to the root folder of this project
  
  ```
  cd /path/to/guess-the-number-python
  ```
<br>

4. DO **NOT** MAKE CHANGES TO THE main BRANCH, create your own branch and name it your name

```
git branch my-user-name
```
<br>

5. Confirm that your new branch `my-user-name` is created

```
git branch
```
<br>

6. Select your new branch `my-user-name` and work on that branch only

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

7. Confirm that you are in your branch `my-user-name` and **NOT** on `main`

```
git branch
```
<br>

<h2>Staying up-to-date with original code: </h2>

1. You have to shift to `main` branch first but do **NOT** `push` to `main` branch

```
git checkout main
```
<br>

2. Perform a `pull` to stay updated. It must show `Already up-to-date`

```
git pull
```
<br>

3. Now you have to shift back to your branch `my-user-name` again before you can continue editing code

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

4. Perform a `pull` again in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git pull
```
<br>

<h2>Once you are ready to push the changes, follow these steps: </h2>

1. Confirm you are in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git branch
```
<br>

2. Push the changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "issue #24 fixed"
```
<br>

3. Choose `git push origin HEAD`, do **NOT** choose `git push origin HEAD:master`

```
git push
git push origin HEAD
```
<br>
